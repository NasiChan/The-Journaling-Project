            <section id="about-section" class="about-content">
                <p><strong>The Journaling Project</strong> is your personal space to vent, reflect, and release. It's a place
                    where you're encouraged to write about what's weighing you down—your frustrations, fears,
                    heartbreaks, or anything that's on your mind.</p>

                <p>Journaling isn't just a creative outlet—it's a powerful mental health tool. Instead of stacking
                    emotions on top of each other until they explode, this project offers a gentle, private way to
                    express them one by one.</p>

                <p>Whether you're glowing with joy or spiraling in silence, The Journaling Project holds space for it all. It's
                    especially helpful before therapy sessions, where it can help you organize your thoughts or bring up
                    things you've been hesitant to say out loud.</p>


                <p>This project was created by <strong>Nas</strong>—a curious coder and chronic overthinker—who believes
                    that writing is a soft rebellion and that journaling heals.</p>

                <p>If you have feedback or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out!</p>

            <h2>How to Use This in Therapy</h2>
            <p>The Burn Book can be your quiet preparation space before a therapy session. Here are a few ways it can
                help:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Note Patterns:</strong> Track recurring emotions or thoughts to understand what keeps coming
                    up for you.</li>
                <li><strong>Write Freely:</strong> Use it to vent about things you're not ready to say out loud yet.
                    Sometimes, writing it down first makes it easier to speak later.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Entries as Prompts:</strong> Bring your entries to therapy as starting points for deeper
                    conversations.</li>
                <li><strong>Highlight Shifts:</strong> Notice how your tone or focus changes over time—it can reflect
                    your growth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There's no “right” way to use this. What matters is that it's honest, personal, and yours.</p>
